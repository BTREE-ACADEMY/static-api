Welcome to BTree Code Academy

Our mission is to help our students to develop a deep and life-long foundation of computer science so that they can learn to think critically, logically, and creatively while welcoming any challenges.

# Communication between parents and Btree Code Academy

## A. Parent Portal

The parent portal is our way of being transparent about your student’s progress.
***We would like to encourage parents to log on to our parent portal every week after each session because it is important to know how your student performs in the class, what curriculum your student learns, and whether your student submits homework assignments every week.***

## B. Email Communication

***Email communication is our primary method to communicate with parents.***
Please be sure to check your email regularly so you do not miss any important information related to your student’s progress, class schedule change, recent updates, etc.

# Importance of Homework 

To ensure all of our students fully understand our curriculum, homework may be given every week in the class. Students need to spend time digesting and understanding each week’s curriculum outside of a class so they are ready to take the next class.  Homework should be submitted before the next class, and our instructors will check every week if it is done properly.

**Unsatisfactory could mean:**
1. homework was not turned in
2. homework was turned in, but it was late and/or insufficient
3. a student tried but couldn’t quite finish it due to difficulty 

**Good could mean:**
homework was turned in on time and is satisfactory to the instructor.

**Great could mean:**
Homework was turned in on time and it shows effort and great quality.

* If a student misses homework for three weeks consecutively and he or she is not keeping up with the class, we will contact you to determine if additional support may be necessary. Otherwise, there is no need to raise a concern but please use it to verify that your student is doing his or her homework to a satisfactory extent. 

# Absent Policy

## Group Class Absent Policy

**Makeup Packet: Attendance plays a critical role in learning code. Therefore, there will be no refund for a missed class. Instead, we will provide a makeup packet that consists of lecture slides, videos, written instructions, and exercises.** 
Please understand that preparing a makeup packet takes our effort and time and it is a way for us to support absentees. Because when we make it, we make sure that it’s detailed enough for absentees to work on the missed material on their own with ease. 

* However, If there is a class with the same level and progress as the missed class, a student may take the class instead of receiving the makeup packet.
